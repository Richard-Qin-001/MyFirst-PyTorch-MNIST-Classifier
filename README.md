# My First Try to Implement A Neural Network

It's hard to believe that writing an MNIST classifier isn't too difficult! Having already learned the basics of Python, I finally implemented a classifier by consulting the PyTorch documentation.

Despite this initial achievement, the program still has some shortcomings that need to be addressed, such as the terrible performance on the images in the /test_images folder that I hand-drew myself.

I will try my best to gain a deeper understanding of Deep Learning and improve this model.
